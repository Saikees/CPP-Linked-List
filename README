--Description--
A generic linked list implementation written in C++. Could be
used for a stack, queue, or to easily sort comparable objects.
The package creates a library so that it may be included with
any program. A test file (main.cpp) is provided in order to
validate the correctness of the library and give an example of
its use.

The package makes use of the Automake utilities. Installation
is straightforward and can be performed by executing the
following commands:
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make install

--Uninstall--
Removing the package is just as easy and can be done by
executing the command:
1) make uninstall
